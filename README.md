My nutrition app is designed to help users make healthier food choices and achieve their health goals. With a user-friendly interface and comprehensive database, the app provides detailed nutrition information for a wide variety of foods. Users can easily search for foods, whether it's a common fruit or vegetable, a popular restaurant dish, or even a specific food product found in supermarkets. For example, even if you search for a relatively unpopular food item like "cereal pillow," the app will return relevant search results.

Once users find the food they're looking for, they can view its nutritional details, including calorie count, macronutrient content, vitamins, and minerals. They can also save their favorite foods to a collection for future reference.

In addition to providing nutrition information, the app also offers a collection of health articles covering various topics related to nutrition, diet, and wellness. Users can access these articles to stay informed and motivated on their health journey.

One of the key features of the app is the Health Goal Setting page, where users can set personalized health goals. By entering their current weight, goal weight, and last week's weight, users can calculate their BMI (Body Mass Index) and track their progress towards their health goals.

Whether you're looking to improve your diet, lose weight, or simply live a healthier lifestyle, our nutrition app is here to support you every step of the way.
